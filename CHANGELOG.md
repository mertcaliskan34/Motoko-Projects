## Learning Journey Notes

This repository represents a complete learning path from basic Motoko concepts to advanced blockchain development:

1. **Foundation**: Started with simple arithmetic operations and state management
2. **Data Structures**: Learned HashMap and Trie implementations
3. **User Interaction**: Built task management and contact systems
4. **Advanced Concepts**: Implemented token standards and governance mechanisms
5. **Best Practices**: Applied proper error handling, documentation, and code organization

Each project builds upon previous concepts, creating a comprehensive learning experience for Internet Computer development.

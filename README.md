> This repository contains educational projects developed during the Internet Computer Bootcamp to learn Motoko programming language and build decentralized applications (dApps) on the Internet Computer (IC).

## Learning Objectives

- Master the fundamentals of Motoko programming language
- Understand Internet Computer canister development
- Learn DFX (IC SDK) usage and deployment
- Build practical dApps with different complexity levels
- Explore governance mechanisms and token standards

## Projects Overview

This repository contains the following learning projects, ordered by complexity:

### ðŸŸ¢ Beginner Level
- **[Calculator](./Calculator/)** - Basic arithmetic operations and state management
- **[Phonebook](./Phonebook/)** - Data storage and retrieval using HashMap

### ðŸŸ¡ Intermediate Level  
- **[ToDoList](./ToDoList/)** - Task management and user interaction patterns
- **[Superhero](./Superhero/)** - CRUD operations and Trie data structure usage

### ðŸ”´ Advanced Level
- **[Token](./Token/)** - ICRC-1 compliant token implementation and standards
- **[Basic_DAO](./Basic_DAO/)** - Decentralized governance and voting mechanisms

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- [DFX (IC SDK)](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/install/index.mdx)

### Running a Project
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository_url>
cd Motoko-Projects

# Navigate to any project
cd Calculator  # or any other project

# Start local IC replica
dfx start

# Deploy the canister
dfx deploy

# Interact with the canister
dfx canister call <canister_name> <method_name> <arguments>
```

## Learning Path

1. **Start with Calculator** - Learn basic Motoko syntax and state management
2. **Move to Phonebook** - Understand data structures and HashMap usage
3. **Try ToDoList** - Explore user interaction and task management
4. **Advance to Superhero** - Master CRUD operations and Trie data structures
5. **Learn Token** - Understand ICRC-1 standards and token mechanics
6. **Master Basic_DAO** - Implement governance and voting systems

## Technologies Used

- **Motoko** - Programming language for Internet Computer
- **Internet Computer (IC)** - Blockchain platform
- **DFX** - Development framework and CLI
- **Trie & HashMap** - Data structures for efficient storage
